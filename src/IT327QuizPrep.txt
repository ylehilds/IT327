Inductors: generate an opposing voltage proportional to the rate of change in current in a circuit.
This property also is called self-inductance to discriminate it from mutual inductance, describing the voltage induced in one electrical circuit
by the rate of change of the electric current in another circuit.


Capacitors: When there is a potential difference (voltage) across the conductors, a static electric field develops across the dielectric,
causing positive charge to collect on one plate and negative charge on the other plate. Energy is stored in the electrostatic field.
An ideal capacitor is characterized by a single constant value, capacitance, measured in farads. This is the ratio of the electric charge on
each conductor to the potential difference between them.
